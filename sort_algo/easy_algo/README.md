|   | Time Complexity (Best, Average, Worst)  | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Bubble Sort  | O(n), O(n^2), O(n^2)  | Works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, standard for `array.sort()` in JS |
| Selection Sort  | O(n^2)  | Works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n), O(n^2), O(n^2)  | Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparisons |
