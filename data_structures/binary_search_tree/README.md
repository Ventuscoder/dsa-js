## Time Complexity for Binary Search Trees
| Operation  | Big O  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Insertion | O(log n) |
| Searching | O(log n) |

For wider trees, DFS is more useful
BFS cannot be used due to large space complexity

For longer trees, BFS is more useful

It is contrasting

### Application for different types of DFS
| DFS  | Use  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| In Order | Used commonly with BSTs, we get all nodes in the tree in their underlying order |
| Pre Order | Can be used to export a tree structure so it is easily reconstructed or copied |
| Post Order | IDK |
