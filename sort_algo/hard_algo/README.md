|   | Time Complexity (Best, Average, Worst)  | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Merge Sort  | O(n log n)  | Works by splitting array, sorting and joining  |
| Quick Sort  | O(n log n), O(n log n), O(n^2)  | Establishes a pivot and sorts on both sides of it  |
| Radix Sort  | O(n+k), k is number of digits  | Very specific cases, used to exploit things like size of digits of a number  |
